# AuraTranslate - Real-Time Voice-Mimicking Translator

AuraTranslate is a groundbreaking platform designed for real-time, bidirectional language translation during live calls. It leverages a sophisticated multi-AI agent system to provide seamless communication between speakers of different languages (initially Spanish and English), delivering translated audio in the original speaker's mimicked voice.

## Core Features

-   **Real-time, Bidirectional Translation**: Near-instantaneous Spanish-English translation with sub-100ms latency.
-   **Voice Mimicry**: A hard-to-copy feature that retains the original speaker's vocal characteristics in the translated audio.
-   **Contextual Understanding**: The AI goes beyond literal translation to accurately interpret idioms, slang, and emotional nuances.
-   **Secure by Design**: Built from the ground up with robust security measures to protect user data and privacy.
