# AI Agents Core System Blueprint

This directory contains the conceptual design and architectural blueprints for the multi-agent AI system that powers AuraTranslate. These documents are the "source of truth" for the core "hard-to-copy" technology of our platform.

## Purpose

The blueprints are not directly runnable code. Instead, they serve as a detailed guide for the AI/ML engineering team to implement the sophisticated real-time translation pipeline. They outline:

-   **System Architecture**: The end-to-end data flow from source audio to translated audio.
-   **Agent Design**: The specific roles and responsibilities of each specialized AI agent (ASR, NMT, Voice Cloning, etc.).
-   **Vertex AI Integration**: How we plan to leverage Google Cloud's Vertex AI APIs (at the free tier) to build our system.
-   **Innovative Solutions**: Details on our proposed workarounds and unique approaches to challenges like real-time voice mimicry and contextual understanding.
-   **Scalability & Security**: High-level strategies for ensuring the AI pipeline is robust, secure, and ready for future growth.

This folder represents the core intellectual property and strategic technical direction for what makes AuraTranslate a next-generation translation service.
