# ASR Agent Design

The Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Agent is responsible for converting spoken language from an audio stream into written text.

## Core Responsibilities

-   **Real-time Transcription**: Utilize streaming speech recognition to provide low-latency transcriptions.
-   **Language Detection**: Automatically identify the language being spoken to apply the correct ASR model.
-   **Speaker Diarization**: Distinguish between speakers in the conversation to attribute text to the correct person.

## Vertex AI Integration

-   **API**: `Vertex AI Speech-to-Text API` (streaming recognition).
-   **Configuration**:
    -   Enable `automatic language detection` for multilingual conversations.
    -   Enable `speaker diarization` to differentiate between speakers.
    -   Use `enhanced models` for better accuracy in noisy environments.

## Handling Challenges

-   [cite_start]**Noise Robustness**: Apply pre-processing techniques like noise cancellation and filtering to improve ASR accuracy in real-world conditions.
-   [cite_start]**Accent and Dialect Handling**: Leverage Vertex AI's models trained on diverse datasets to handle various accents and dialects.
-   [cite_start]**Disfluencies**: Implement post-processing logic to detect and remove filler words ("um," "ah") and repetitions for cleaner transcriptions that are easier to translate.

This agent is a critical first step in the pipeline, and its accuracy directly impacts the overall quality of the translation.
