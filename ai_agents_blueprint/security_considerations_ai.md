# AI Pipeline Security Considerations

Security is paramount, especially when handling sensitive voice and conversational data.

## Key Security Measures

-   **Data in Transit**: All communication between the user's device, the backend, and the AI agents must be encrypted using TLS 1.2+.
-   **Data at Rest**: Any temporarily stored data (like audio chunks for processing) must be encrypted.
-   **Authentication**: Internal calls between AI agents (microservices) must be authenticated using a secure token-based system (e.g., OAuth 2.0 or JWT) to prevent unauthorized access.
-   **Voiceprint Security**: User voiceprints are considered highly sensitive biometric data. They must be stored with strong encryption and strict access controls.
-   **Ethical Safeguards**: The system must include robust safeguards against the misuse of voice cloning technology, such as adding an inaudible watermark to synthesized audio to identify it as AI-generated. The terms of service must be explicit about how voice data is used, requiring clear user consent.
